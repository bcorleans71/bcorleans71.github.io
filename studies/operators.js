//Operators are symbols used to perform various operations in Javascript.
//Assignment Operators assign a value to its left operand based on the value to the right.
var a = b;
//a has been assigned to and is now equal to 1. 
// Next is the addition assigment operator adds the value of the right operand to a variable 
//and assigns the result to the variable. 
var b = a += b; a = a + b;
// var b = a += b; is the same as writing a = a + b;
//Next is the subtraction assigment operator subtracts the value of the left operand to a variable 
//and assigns the result to the variable. 
a -= b; a = a - b;
//The multiplication assignment operator multiplies a variable by the value of the right operand
//and assigns the result to the variable. 
a *= b; a = a * b;
//The division assignment operator divides a variable by the value of the right operand 
//and assigns the result to the variable.  
a /= b; a = a / b;
//The remainder assignment operator divides a variable by the value of the right operand 
//and assigns the remainder to the variable.
a %= b; a = a % b;
//Another set of operaotrs are called comparison operators. 
//A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on
//whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, 
//or object values.   
//The equality operator converts the operands if they are not of the same type, 
//then applies strict comparison. Three equals signs is strict equality and should always be used 
a === b;
//The bang operator or the symbol ! denotes inequality or not equal to. It can be placed before  
// a value.
a !== b;
//The greater than or equal operator returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal
//to the right operand.
a >= b;
//The greater than operator returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
a > b;
//The less than or equal operator returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
a <= b;
//The less than operator returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.
a < b;
//Logical Operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are,
//they return a Boolean value.
// An example of logical AND operator 
a = a && b; 
//An example of the logical OR operator 
a = a || b;
//An example of the logical not equal to or bang operator 
a != b;
